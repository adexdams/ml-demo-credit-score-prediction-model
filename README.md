# üßÆ Credit Score Classification Project

---

## üìä **Project Overview**

The primary objective of this project was to develop a robust machine learning model to accurately classify credit scores into **Good**, **Standard**, and **Poor** categories based on diverse financial and demographic features. Through a structured data science approach involving **data wrangling**, **feature selection**, **model optimization**, and **evaluation**, the final model achieved a **high accuracy of 85.33%** on the **test set**.

## üîç **Key Findings**

### 1. **Model Performance**
- The **RandomForestClassifier** with **optimized parameters** provided the best results, outperforming the initial baseline models.
- Demonstrated strong **generalization ability** with:
  - **Cross-validation accuracy:** 84.25%
  - **Test set accuracy:** 85.33%

### 2. **Feature Importance**
- The most influential features in determining **credit scores** included:
  - **Annual Income**
  - **Credit History Age**
  - **Outstanding Debt**
- Feature analysis provided insights into **key financial behaviors** contributing to **creditworthiness**.

### 3. **Model Stability**
- The **confusion matrix** and **classification report** showed balanced performance across all **credit score categories**, with **high precision and recall**.

### 4. **Insights from Visualizations**
- Individuals with **higher incomes** and **longer credit histories** were more likely to have **good credit scores**.
- The **number of loans** and **credit utilization ratio** also played significant roles in **credit score classification**.

### 5. **Test Case Predictions**
- The model was tested with **edge case scenarios**, demonstrating reliable predictions with custom **decision thresholds**:
- High-income, low-debt scenarios accurately predicted as **Credit_Score_Standard**.
- Low-income, high-debt scenarios correctly identified as **Credit_Score_Poor**.
- The thresholds addition minimized **overlap** in predictions, enhancing **classification accuracy**.
